				<p>John Coltrane was an American jazz saxophonist born in 1926 in Hamlet, North Carolina.  In 1943, while he was in high school, his family moved to Philadelphia where he spent a few more years before enlisting in the Navy in 1945.  Coltrane spent a year in the Navy, stationed in Pearl Harbor, and played saxophone with a variety of bands on the base.  After being discharged, Coltrane performed on both alto and tenor saxophone with Jimmy Heath and Eddie Vinson throughout the end of the 1940s and early 1950s.</p>

				<p>Coltrane's major breakthrough was when he joined renowned trumpeter Miles Davis and recorded a number of albums between 1955 and 1957.  These albums are considered to represent Davis' First Great Quintet, but the association failed to last long due to Coltrane's struggles with a heroin addiction.  Coltrane's output during this period reflects fairly typical bebop and hard-bop playing of the 1950s, but is amplified by the intensity and breadth of his sound.  After leaving Davis' quintet, Coltrane worked with pianist Thelonious Monk and also recorded an album for Blue Note records as a leader, titled <cite>Blue Trane</cite>.</p>

				<p>Some of the major landmarks of Coltrane's career are marked by his experimentation with traditional jazz chord progressions.  Coltrane substituted unique chords in place of more traditional progressions, resulting in what became known as "Trane Changes".  He utilized these techniques in both his compositions and solos throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, most notably seen on his album <cite>Giant Steps</cite>.  Coltrane's career took a different turn in 1962, however, when he built his own quartet and began touring with these musicians for several years.  Some of the ideas utilized in this music involved freer soloistic performances and less of a strict adherence to the chord changes, flying in the face of the principles he developed on <cite>Giant Steps</cite>.  This development can be linked to Coltrane's performance on Davis' album <cite>Kind of Blue</cite>, which included compositions with sparse chord changes and more freedom for the improviser.</p>

				<p>Coltrane's career culminated in the mid-late 1960s by pushing the boundaries of jazz music, through experiments with avant-garde and free jazz.  Coltrane utilized extended saxophone techniques, altissimo, multiphonics, overtones, and included other avant-garde jazz musicians of the era.  His output from this period was extraordinarily divisive, and lacks the praise often attributed to his earlier work.  Coltrane died in 1967 of liver cancer, living to the age of 40.  His legacy and impact on modern jazz music is tremendous, and includes his sound, style, compositions and approach to improvisation.</p>
